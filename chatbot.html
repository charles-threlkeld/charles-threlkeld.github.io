	    Warning: This project was abandoned before coming to fruition. I learned a lot and built a backbone, but this was during a leave from work. When I returned, I was advised to work on a different project rather than this one.

      <h4>The Problem</h4>

      <p>Timing can often affect the way we are understood in conversation. From personal experience and observational scientific data, this seems to be the case. However, experimentally controlling timing in conversation is extremely difficult. Precise timing by people is not plausible, and plausible response by computers has long been elusive.</p>
      
      <h4>The Goal</h4>

      <p>I might be able to solve the plausibility problem with a text-generation engine, like Chat-GPT. The goal of this project is to create the rest of a chatbot engine that can be used to allow for experimentally manipulating timing in a human-robot interaction.</p>
