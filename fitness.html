      <h1>Fitness Analysis via Strava API</h1>
      </br>
      <h4>The Problem</h4>

      <p>In 2021, I was training for a marathon. I had written up a training schedule for myself, but I wanted a dashboard to show how well I was meeting my goals.</p>
      
      <h4>The Goal</h4>

      <p>I wanted to make a spreadsheet that would pull information about my runs each day and update a dashboard to show things like how long I ran, how hard the run was for me, and what the plan was for the next day/week.</p>
      
      <h4>The Background</h4>

      <p>In the past, I have used Training Peaks for triathlon training, but the analysis and modeling that Training Peaks does is not too complicated. The recording comes from the smart watch, which basically tracks time-stamped GPS coordinates, plus other parameters if they are connected, e.g., heart rate, power (cycling), cadence (running or cycling).</p>
