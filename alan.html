      <h1>ALAN: Another Language ANalyzer</h1>
      </br>
      <h4>The Problem</h4>
      <p>Proper transcription and annotation is essential for studying language. These tools allow us to simplify spoken dialogue into parsable data for analysis. However, <a href="https://dali.talkbank.org/clan/">CLAN</a> is showing its age and is unlikely to be updated any time soon. Further, CLAN relies on a host of 32-bit libraries that are unavailable on modern user's systems, and it never suppored Linux in the first place.</p>
      <h4>The Goal</h4>
      <p> My goal was to create a new text editor that would reimplement many of CLAN's features, but rely on newer 64-bit libraries and target Linux, Mac, and Windows operating systems.</p>
