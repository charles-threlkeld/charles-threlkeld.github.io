What problem do Speech Acts solve?
</p>

<p>
In the early 20th century, philosophers of language (working from Wittgenstein's <i>Tractatus Logicio-Philisophicus</i>) posited that language is the vehicle we use to make claims on the world. The important part of language is that it creates propositions, which are either true or false regarding the way the world is. Wittgenstein thought that if a sentence is neither true or false, then it is nonsense, and cannot be used in philosophical reasoning. Wittgenstein's purpose in making this distinction is to delineate what can or cannot be done with philosophy. Working in this framework, many previously important philosophical debates are immediately categorized as nonsense. What is the purpose of life? What is justice? These types of questions have no truth or falsehood in the world, and so debate on them can be thrown in the nonsense bin. Wittgenstein's <i>Tractatus</i> has been roundly rejected on a few different points by many philosophers over the years (including Wittgenstein himself), but it helps us set the stage for the entrance of Speech Act Theory.
</p>

<p>
JL Austin was concerned that there are many things we do with language that are not necessarily true or false, but instead change parts of the world through their utterance. In his series of lectures <i>Doing Things With Words</i>, Austin first explored how certain utterances change the nature of their propositions through the act of utterance and the Speech Act was born. In Wittgenstein's terms, a sentence like `the boat is named the Queen Elizabeth' is certainly a true or false statement about the world. It is therefore permissible to reason about. Austin first concerned himself with what he termed <i>explicit performatives</i> such as `I name this boat the Queen Elizabeth.' What Austin found interesting about these types of sentences is that the proposition that they posit (i.e., that the boat is named Queen Elizabeth) is false before the utterance and true afterward, and the truth is based on the fact that someone has named the boat<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1" role="doc-backlink">1</a></sup>. In this way, the speech (i.e., an utterance) performs an action (i.e., changes the state of the world).
</p>

<p>
In itself, this is rather a revelation. Logicians have long struggled with formalizing the logic of everyday utterances. Existential qualifiers, universal qualifiers, inclusive-or statements, and material conditional are all compromises around the vagaries of natural language that seek to formalize it in a way to work with boolean algebra. What sets performative utterances apart is that they can only be reasoned with yet more abstract terms. `I name this boat Queen Elizabeth' cannot be true or false, even as the contained propositional content becomes true in the utterance of the sentence. Therefore, even in principle, a performative cannot be captured in logic without accounting for its performance.
</p>

<p>
So, Austin continues and searches for a pattern that demarcates this type of utterance in the semantics of English. Many utterances may be explicitly performative. For example, `I apologize.' However, there may be some vagaries, too. `I am sorry' and `I repent' are similar to `I apologize,' but their meaning is describes the feelings of the speaker and while the apology may be implied, it is not explicit. Some speech acts are always implied, such as implying or insinuating. The grammar of English does not allow for sentences like `I imply that this boat is named Queen Elizabeth,' even if that is my intention.
</p>

<p>
Note that implicit performatives can often be made explicit by changing the words of a sentence. `This boat is hereby named the Queen Elizabeth' and `I hereby name this boat the Queen Elizabeth' have the same speech act, namely that of <i>naming</i>. We can see that moving a sentence into a `that'-phrase can often allow us to transform sentence utterances from implicit to explicit performatives. `The cat is on the mat' may become `I know that the cat is on the mat,' `I warn you that the cat is on the mat,' or `I believe that the cat is on the mat.' Each of these transformations is a <i>construal</i> of the sentence `the cat is on the mat' when the sentence is uttered without the prefix and an explicit performative when uttered as a whole.
</p>

<p>
We see there is a difference between the words uttered and the speech act performed. Austin terms the words uttered the <i>locutionary</i> act and the speech act performed is the <i>illocutionary</i> act. The locutionary act is further broken down into the <i>phonetic</i>, <i>phatic</i>, and <i>rhetic</i> acts which mirror the phonemes spoken, the lexico-grammatical tokens (i.e., the words), and the sense and reference of the utterance. In the example of naming a boat, the locutionary act is different since the words are not the same, the illocutionary act is the identical<sup><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2" role="doc-backlink">2</a></sup>.
</p>

<p>
And so we can now see the important distinction between the words we say in an utterance and the act of saying them. Austin puts the two aspects of an utterance as the locutionary meaning (sense and reference) with a truth/falsehood dimension and the illocutionary force with a happiness/unhappiness dimension. The locutionary meaning with its truth and falsehood describes the propositional content of the utterance and what it says about the world. The illocutionary force describes the speech act of the utterance and whether or not is it is felicitous in performance. 
</p>

<p>
Finally, we will address the <i>perlocutionary</i> force of an utterance, which is the changing of thoughts and feelings of a speaker and audience in via an utterance. Consider `Austin makes important points about how language works.' The illocutionary force of this sentence is to argue. If my argument changes your mind and I convince you that Austin indeed <i>does</i> make good points, then the perlocutionary force is that of <i>convincing</i>. Neither the arguing for the proposition or convincing my audience are explicitly contained in the words of the sentence, but they are the forces that change the states of the world by virtue of being said.
</p>

<p>
I introduce the perlocutionary force for two reasons. First, the happiness or unhappiness of an utterance does not depend on its acceptance by the audience. I may still argue that Austin's points are important without convincing you of the same. Second, the coupling of illocutionary force by the speaker and perlocutionary force on the audience is a kernel into the notion of <i>sequence organization</i>. Austin does not discuss this point in detail, but it is a crucial aspect of the research in this paper, and will be discussed below. In short, a speech act such as <i>asking</i> invites a response, i.e., <i>answering</i>.
</p>

<p>
A note on perlocutions &#x2014; above our examples show that perlocutions often pair with illocutions, but this is not necessarily so. For example, there is no illocution for surprise, upset or humiliate <sup><a id="fnr.3" class="footref" href="#fn.3" role="doc-backlink">3</a></sup>. So Austin's framework allows intentions of illocution, sequence organization in normative responses, and also abnormal responses when unexpected perlocutions result from our actions.
</p>

<p>
I have been speaking in general terms about speech acts, and attempting to label them in obvious ways for the examples so far. A formalized theory of speech acts must enumerate the set of acts that any utterance may perform. This is the crux of the work in Chapters 4 and 5 of this paper, and the remainder of this chapter discusses different approaches to this topic, as well as setting the stage for the author's own approach.
</p>

<p>
Austin himself notes that there may be on the order of \(10^3\) speech acts available in English. He gets this estimate from a brief survey of the dictionary, noting that this is the likely range for words that characterize the utterances we used. For example `he noted,' `she declared', `they estimated,' are some of the lexicalized speech acts in English. By virtue of being different words, Austin suggests that they may be meaningfully different actions.
</p>

<p>
In contrast to this high estimate, Austin also gives us a lower estimate of five families of speech act: verdictives, exercitives, comissives, behabitives, and expositives. These roughly correspond to judgements, exercising of powers, promises, social behaviors (e.g., <i>apologize</i>, <i>congratulate</i>, <i>curse</i>), and the acts within conversation (e.g., <i>reply</i>, <i>concede</i>, <i>assume</i>). Austin is clear that this is simply a sketch of a schematic, but his point is that speech acts may be more or less similar to each other based on the way in which they act upon the world with their illocutionary force. Promises are made by a person only on their own behalf. Exercitives, by contrast, are available only to those with vested power to use them. Rarely do we find these categories used in current research, but they are interesting as perhaps the original schematic by which we might classify speech acts.
</p>

<p>
But why should we want to classify speech acts? Philosophically, we want to classify speech acts in order to know how our utterance affects the state of the world. If we make a promise, what does that mean for the our beliefs and expectations about the future? And more to the point: what constitutes making a promise? Psychologically, speech acts are critical to understanding how language works between people. If we can label an utterance with an accurate speech act, then we know the purpose of the utterance, what purpose that speaker had in uttering it. Finally, we want to label speech acts in order to compute with them. If we label a set of speech acts, we can train a recognizer. The recognizer is not an end in itself but can be utilized to enable automated reasoning about utterances. A computational recognizer for promises means that promises can be tracked by software, enabling fuller understanding of natural language for use in many applications of natural language understanding and generation.
</p>

<p>
Is it possible to label speech acts? Criticism of explicit speech act labeling notes that we are both inflating and deflating the utterance when we label it as a single speech act. A single utterance may be labeled as a retort, reply, threat, muttering, or any number of arguably correct descriptions. But each of these is a <i>construal</i> rather than necessarily the (or an) intended action. Each locution that we produce is formed of words and their meaning, but if the words themselves are not explicit about the action, it is not clear that an <i>ex post facto</i> and <i>ex tempore</i> label will remain true to the  meaning <i>in tempore</i> or to the speaker at the time of utterance. This line of reasoning is taken Lakoff and Johnson (TODO: Cite page) in The Metaphors We Live By where they note that no two sentences have the same meaning, and that by adjusting even the word order, we change the focus of the sentence. Similarly, Goodman (TODO: citation and read original) notes that there are no synonyms since no two words have exactly the same meaning. Similarly, (TODO: cite) argue that no two illocutions have the same force.
</p>

<p>
I offer three arguments against these criticisms. The first is that classification does not imply identity. By classifying an utterance with a label, I do not make the claim that this is the only, best, ideal, or even a common way of performing the speech act label, only that it seems to be an instance of it. Promises can be made without uttering `I promise` just as threats can be made without specifying consequences (`or else&#x2026;'). Secondly, the lexicalization of speech acts suggests that there is a category well-known to English speakers for categorizing utterances in certain ways. If we weren't performing actions, such as `replying' or `denying,' how could we use these words in every day speech and be well understood? The final defense comes from Searle, who says that if our tests do not produce the results from regular use of language, the tests are wrong, not the language. Searle offers the phrase `eye doctor that is not an oculist.' This describes an eye doctor and not an oculist. This shows that the extensions of each can be different, breaking a property we expect of synonyms. Searle argues that if this property breaks, this is a fault in our test for synonyms rather than in synonymy itself. Likewise, it is my position that the same speech act can be performed with different utterances, and if our tests regarding speech acts fail, it is a problem with our tests, not with our ability to label.
</p>

<p>
Speech act theory is an exceptionally broad topic. It has been used in philosophy, linguistics, psychology, and computer science to very different ends and with very different means. In order to get at the aspects of speech act theory that we are particularly interested in for this paper, we will discuss some background in each of these areas, as well as some nay-saying about the efficacy of this approach to language.

Austin goes on to note that what he terms <i>felicity conditions</i> must apply for the speech act to be ``happy.'' So, the speaker must be designated to name the boat, the boat must not have another name, the speaker must not be quoting someone they heard or reading a poem aloud, etc.

If the exact words used in boat naming are of the utmost importance in the ritual, then I may be incorrect in this assessment, since one of these may fail to meet the felicity conditions necessary for naming the boat (see above). But this is a circumstance about boat naming in particular, rather than speech acts in general.

These are Austin's examples on the basis that we cannot say `I surprise you that X' or `I upset you that X.' This seems to contradict his assertion that certain illocutions cannot be explicit, such as imply or insinuate, since even if my intention is to surprise or upset, this cannot be the illocution. The difference is that the surprisal, upset, etc. is necessarily secondary to the propositional content. For example, `Theresa is engaged` may surprise or upset you, but the illocutionary force is to inform. Contrast this with `Theresa was wearing a diamond ring on her third left finger` for which the force is to imply.
