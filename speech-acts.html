      <h4>The Problem</h4>
      <p>Speech Act study tends to be a fractures field as many studies use their own schema for labeling speech acts, making comparisons between studies difficult. This also prevents researchers from building on each other's work, as different schemas require different data types and different assumptions. Often, even data that uses "the same" schema adapts it to fit a new use case or scenario, making the data incompatible in the process. This also means there is no way to verify which schemas are appropriate or useful for any particular purpose.</p>
      <h4>The Goal</h4>
      <p>In this project, I sought to remove the human-judgement element from Speech Act annotation, and create a data-first schema that can be replicated across different data sets by disperate researchers. Rather than rely solely on hand-coded annotations, I wanted to use univeral aspects of conversation ()syntactic forms, length of utterances, length of transitions) and conversational context (previous and next speech acts) as the basis for speech act modeling. Exploratory research showed that there was still a lot of signal in hand-annotations, and so I also use them as a springboard for creating of a new schema, which is applicable to new data without re-training models.</p>
